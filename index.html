        <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <div>Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their
            codenames. Spymasters take turns giving ONE-WORD clues. A clue may relate to multiple words on the table. The field
            operatives try to guess which words their spymaster meant. When a field operative touches a word, the
            spymaster reveals its secret identity. If the field operatives guess correctly, they may continue guessing,
            until they run out of ideas for the given clue or until they hit a wrong person. Then it is the other team's
            turn to give a clue and guess. The first team to contact all their agents wins the game.  </div>
        <h2>Game Play</h2>
        <div> Each team will designate one player to be their <b>Spymaster</b>. Being a <b>Spymaster</b> isn't a simple task but gets
            easier each time you try! At the start of your team's turn, your team's Spymaster will create a clue using just ONE WORD.
            They'll also include a number after the word, indicating how many words on the board correspond to that. For example, if
            the Spymaster gave the clue "Fruit 2", you should look through the board to see which words could match that description.
            Once you click on a card, one of four results will occur:
            <ul id = "rules">
                <li>If you select a card with <b>YOUR TEAM'S COLOR</b>, you contact your agent and can continue guessing.</li>
                <li>If you select a card with the <b>ENEMY TEAM'S COLOR</b>, their agent is contacted and you can no longer guess.</li>
                <li>If you select a <b>NEUTRAL CARD</b> (gray color), you can no longer guess.</li>
                <li>If you select <b>THE ASSASSIN</b> (black color), you <b>LOSE the game instantly.</b></li>
            </ul>
